# Token Velocity iPython Algorithm
---
This iPython script contains the algorithm used to parse BitShares's blockchain for historical data on the transaction history of top BTS holders to estimate the velocity of BTS tokens. **Token velocity** is defined as the total BTS transaction volume divided by the amount of BTS holdings in the same time period. In this analysis, we looked at the past year's worth of trading history for the top 200 holders of BTS tokens (available at http://cryptofresh.com/a/BTS).
